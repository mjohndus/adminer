AdminNeo
==========

**AdminNeo** is a full-featured database management tool written in PHP. It consists of a single file ready to deploy 
to the target server. As a companion, **EditorNeo** offers data manipulation for end-users. 

Supported database drivers:
- MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL, Oracle, MongoDB, SimpleDB, Elasticsearch (beta), ClickHouse (alpha)

AdminNeo is based on the [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) project by Jakub Vrána.

Requirements
------------

- PHP 7.1+ with enabled sessions, modern web browser.

It is also recommended to install [OpenSSL PHP extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php) for improved
security of stored login information.

Security
--------

AdminNeo does not allow connecting to databases without a password, and it also rate-limits connection attempts to protect
against brute force attacks. However, it is highly recommended to **restrict access to AdminNeo** 🔒 by whitelisting IP
addresses allowed to connect to it, by password protecting access in your web server or by enabling security plugins
(e.g., to require an OTP).

Migration from older versions
-----------------------------

Version 5 has been significantly redesigned and refactored. Unfortunately, this has resulted in many changes that break
backward compatibility.

A complete list of changes can be found in the [Upgrade Guide](/docs/upgrade.md).

Docker
------

The official Docker image is available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/peterknut/adminneo). Please follow the
instructions on the Docker page to get started.

Usage
-----

Download one of the latest [release files](https://github.com/adminneo-org/adminneo/releases), upload to the HTTP server 
with PHP and enjoy 😉. If you are not satisfied with any combination of the database driver, language and theme, you can 
download the source code and compile your own AdminNeo:

- Download the source code.
- Run `composer install` to install dependencies.
- Run bin/compile.php:

```shell
# AdminNeo
php bin/compile.php [drivers] [languages] [themes] [config-file.json]

# EditorNeo
php bin/compile.php editor [drivers] [languages] [themes] [config-file.json]
```

Where:
- `drivers` is a comma-separated list of [database drivers](/admin/drivers) or the value `all-drivers`.
  The default set is: mysql, pgsql, mssql, sqlite.
- `languages` is a comma-separated list of [languages](/admin/translations).
  If not specified, all languages will be included.
- `themes` is a comma-separated list of [themes](/admin/themes) together with specific color variant. E.g. 
  `default-blue`, `default-red`, etc. If not specified, only the `default-blue` theme will be included. The `+` 
  character can be used as a wildcard in the theme name.
- `config-file.json` is a path to the custom JSON configuration file. It contains a class with [the same parameters](#configuration) 
  that can be configured in Admin constructor.

If the theme name contains a postfix with one of the supported color variants (-green, -red), the corresponding favicons
will be included automatically.

For example:
```shell
# Default set of drivers, all languages, only default-blue theme.
php bin/compile.php

# Only pgsql driver, only EN language, only default-blue theme.
php bin/compile.php pgsql en

# Only mysql and pgsql driver, selected languages, only default-blue theme.
php bin/compile.php mysql,pgsql en,de,cs,sk

# Default set of drivers, all languages, green and red color variants of the default theme. 
# Blue color variant will be not available.
php bin/compile.php default-green,default-red

# Default theme together with all color variants.
php bin/compile.php default+

# Custom configuration.
php bin/compile.php ~/my-config.json
```

Editor examples:
```shell
# Default set of drivers, all languages, default theme (without color variants).
php bin/compile.php editor

# Only pgsql driver, only EN language, default theme with all color variants.
php bin/compile.php editor pgsql en default+
```

JSON configuration file example:
```json
{
    "navigationMode": "reversed"
}
```

Configuration
-------------

You can define a configuration as a constructor parameter. Create `index.php` file implementing `create_adminneo()` 
method that returns configured `Admin` instance.

```php
<?php

use AdminNeo\Admin;

function create_adminneo(): Admin 
{
    // Define configuration.
    $config = [
        "colorVariant" => "green",
    ];
	
    return new Admin($config);
}

// Include AdminNeo file.
include "adminneo.php";
```

### Configuration parameters

All parameters available in AdminNeo are listed in the following table. Parameters available in EditorNeo are labeled in
the Editor column.

Plugins
-------

AdminNeo functions can be changed or extended by plugins. Plugins are managed by `Pluginer` customization class. 

* Download `Pluginer.php` and plugins you want and place them into the `plugins` folder.
* Create `index.php` file implementing `create_adminneo()` method that returns Pluginer instance.

File structure will be:

```
- plugins
    - Pluginer.php
    - dump-xml.php
    - tinymce.php
    - file-upload.php
    - ...
- adminneo.php
- index.php
```

Index.php:

```php
<?php

use AdminNeo\Pluginer;

function create_adminneo(): Pluginer
{
    // Required to run any plugin.
    include "plugins/Pluginer.php";
    
    // Include plugins.
    include "plugins/dump-xml.php";
    include "plugins/tinymce.php.php";
    include "plugins/file-upload.php";
    
    // Enable plugins.
    $plugins = [
        new XmlDumpPlugin(),
        new TinyMcePlugin(),
        new FileUploadPlugin("data/"),
        // ...
    ];
    
    // Define configuration.
    $config = [
        "colorVariant" => "green",
    ];
    
    return new Pluginer($plugins, $config);
}

// Include AdminNeo or EditorNeo.
include "adminneo.php";
```

[Available plugins](plugins).

Custom CSS and JavaScript
-------------------------

It is possible to modify the appearance and functionality by creating a custom CSS or JavaScript file. AdminNeo will
automatically include files `adminneo.css`, `adminneo-light.css`, `adminneo-dark.css` and `adminneo.js` that are
placed in the AdminNeo's current working directory (typically next to the index.php).

- adminneo.css - Should be compatible with automatic switching to dark mode.
- adminneo-light.css - Will force AdminNeo to use only the light mode.
- adminneo-dark.css - Will force the dark mode.

Main project files
------------------

- admin/index.php - Run development version of AdminNeo.
- editor/index.php - Run development version of EditorNeo.
- editor/example.php - Example Editor customization.
- admin/plugins.php - Plugins demo.
- admin/sqlite.php - Development version of AdminNeo with SQLite allowed.
- editor/sqlite.php - Development version of Editor with SQLite allowed.
- bin/compile.php - Create a single file version.
- bin/update-translations.php - Update translation files.
- tests/katalon.html - Katalon Automation Recorder test suite.

What to expect
--------------

Our top priority is fixing the security issues and reported bugs. But we also want to move forward and transform
AdminNeo to a tool with a clean modern UI and simple configuration.

### Version 4.x

Original design and backward compatibility is maintained. Many bugs have been fixed and several functional and 
UI improvements have been introduced.

### Version 5

Bridges are burned 🔥🔥🔥. Our goals are:

- **Requirements** - Bump minimal PHP to 7.1. 
- **Themes** – Brand-new default theme based on our old [Adminer theme](https://github.com/pematon/adminer-theme). It will support dark mode and configurable 
color variants for production/devel environment. All current designs will be removed. 
- **Plugins** - Integrate several basic plugins, enable them by simple optional configuration.
- **Codebase** - Prefer code readability before minimalism, use PER coding style, add a namespace.
- **Compilation** - Allow to export selected drivers, themes, languages and plugins into a single PHP file.
