Upgrade guide
=============

Migrating to 5.0
----------------

- Minimum required PHP version is 7.1.

- Compiled file was renamed to `adminneo.php` for database Admin and `editorneo.php` for Editor. Update your include
  statement if you use custom AdminNeo configuration.

```php
// Include AdminNeo file.

```

  using this new namespace. Simple index.php will look like this:

```php
<?php

use AdminNeo\Admin;

function create_adminneo(): Admin 
{
    return new Admin();
}

include "adminneo.php";
```

- AdminNeo has a brand-new default design that is incompatible with the previous one. All alternative designs was
  removed. If you use custom `adminer.css` file, you can delete it. If you use
  [Adminer theme](https://github.com/pematon/adminer-theme) by Pematon, delete all related files. New default theme 
  supports dark mode and color variants. See [Configuration options](/docs/configuration.md) for more information.

  `adminer.css`.
