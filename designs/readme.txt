Copy adminer.css alongside Adminer PHP script to use an alternative design.

If you want to easily test all the designs:
    - Copy all the designs into the "designs" folder (ie designs/ng9/adminer.css)
    - Install the "designs" plugin (see the plugin installation documentation).
A dropdown list will appear in the bottom right for selecting your design.
Once you have chosen your design, it is best to:
    - Copy the adminer.css file to the root directory,
    - Disable the "designs" plugin,
    - Delete the designs.
